The user, communicating in Portuguese, has iteratively guided the development of a full-stack Point-of-Sale (POS) application for a fruit and vegetable stand. The project began with a core requirement to replace an Excel-based system, specifying data models for customers, products, and orders, along with corresponding UI pages for CRUD operations, a sales panel, and receipt printing.

The AI engineer successfully built this MVP using a FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. Subsequent user requests progressively added significant features: a sales history page with filters; a comprehensive analytics dashboard with multiple charts; a complete JWT-based authentication system with a login screen and protected routes; UI enhancements like adding a company logo and transforming the top navigation bar into a collapsible side-menu; and finally, bulk data import/export capabilities for sales and customers via CSV. The application was also fully containerized using Docker and Nginx.

The most recent request is a significant pivot: to completely remove all authentication (login screen, JWT, protected routes) from the entire application, making it fully open and accessible for local use. The AI has begun this process by modifying the backend  file to remove JWT dependencies and route protections. The next agent should respond in Portuguese.

<product_requirements>
The project is a comprehensive, full-stack Point-of-Sale (POS) web application designed to replace a manual Excel spreadsheet for a fruit and vegetable stand (quitanda). The application is built with a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and a MongoDB database.

Core Features Implemented:
-   **Entity Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for Customers and Products.
-   **Sales Panel:** A primary operational screen to create new orders by adding products (searchable by code or name), selecting a registered customer, or processing an anonymous sale.
-   **Sales History:** A filterable and paginated list of all past orders, with options to view details, delete sales (with a confirmation modal), and import sales in bulk from a CSV file.
-   **Customer History:** A list of customers with options to import them in bulk via CSV.
-   **Analytics Dashboard:** A page with visual charts and KPIs, including sales by day/month, top-selling products, and sales by category.
-   **Receipt Printing:** A dedicated, printer-friendly view for generating sales receipts.
-   **Dockerization:** The entire application stack (frontend, backend, database) is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose for easy, one-command local deployment.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** React.js (JavaScript)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker-Compose
- **Web Server/Proxy:** Nginx
- **Styling:** CSS
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts, Chart.js
- **Authentication (being removed):** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo-like structure with distinct  and  directories, containerized for deployment.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**
-   : A monolithic FastAPI file containing all API endpoints, database models (Pydantic), and business logic for customers, products, orders, and analytics. It was recently modified to start removing JWT authentication logic.
-   : A large, monolithic React component that contains the logic and rendering for all pages/routes (Sales, Customers, Products, History, Dashboard), state management, and API calls. It's the central piece of the frontend.
-   : A single CSS file containing all styles for the application, including the layout, components, responsive design, and print styles.
-   : Manages authentication state (token, isAuthenticated). This file and its logic are slated for complete removal.
-   : Manages the state (open/closed) of the collapsible side navigation bar.
-   : Defines and orchestrates the four main services:  (actually MongoDB), , , and . It configures networking, volumes, and environment variables.
-   : Configures the Nginx reverse proxy to route  requests to the backend service and serve the static React frontend for all other requests.
-   : Contains detailed instructions for setting up and running the project using Docker Compose.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no pending tasks from previous, completed requests. The user accepted the solution of receiving a downloadable  archive instead of having the AI push to GitHub or build a Docker image.

<current_work>
The current and active task is to **completely remove the authentication system** from the application, making all features publicly accessible.

This work was initiated in the last few messages of the trajectory. The process began on the backend:
1.  **File Edited:** 
2.  **Actions Taken:**
    *   The  endpoint and its associated logic were removed.
    *   JWT-related imports (, , etc.) were removed.
    *   A script () was run to automatically remove the  dependency from all protected API routes to make them public.
3.  **Current State:** The AI successfully removed the bulk of the route protections but noted that some manual cleanup might still be necessary in . The frontend part of the authentication removal (deleting , , , and refactoring ) has not yet started. The application is in a partially modified state where the backend has been altered, but the frontend still expects an authentication flow.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue removing all traces of authentication by manually verifying and cleaning up any remaining  in . Then, proceed to remove the authentication logic from the frontend.
